# Computer-Vision
These are the lab assignments Image Processing and Computer Vision unit, as well as the final coursework. For the final coursework, we were tasked to use OpenCV in C++ to analyze a given Viola-Jones face-detection algorithm. We were then tasked to train a Viola-Jones dartboard detector and improve on it using the Hough Transform to reduce the false-positive rate.
